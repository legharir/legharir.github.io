			<h1>I'm Rafay Leghari.</h1>
			<p>I am a <a href="https://github.com/legharir">programmer</a> and software engineering student at McMaster University. I like to play badminton and werewolf, one of my favourite board games. Currently, I'm interning at SAP in Toronto as a quality engineer. During my time here, I've been busy automating test suites and writing bugfixes with Python and Java.

			<h2>I like making things.</h2>
			<p>Here are some of the projects I've worked on over the past few years:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Developed the control logic and program for the <i>Sitallite</i>, a fully controllable ballon craft that was deployed at <a href="http://www.vanwyn.com">VanWyn</a>. Implemented C++ programs utilising the Pozyx system and multiple microcontrollers to enable wireless control of the drone. In order to fine tune the flight, I also developed a JavaFX based GUI that could perform flight tests on the drone and output flight information to a file. Here is a video of the first flight:

					<source src="videos/firstflight.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Unfortunately, your browser does not support the video.
				</video>
					<li>
						Worked with a team of 4 to develop <a href="https://github.com/legharir/ScanShop-">ScanShop</a>, an Android application that can scan a product's barcode (UPC/EAN), then search through a dataset to display retailers that sell the item online, sorted by descending order of selling price. For this project, I implemented a JSON parser that is able to translate product information from zipped JSON files to product objects. A trie was implemented to search through the dataset, allowing users to query products using substrings of the product name, rather than exclusively scanning the product's barcode.
					</li>
					<li>
						Recreated 'Color Switch', a popular mobile game, on the web. Implemented using Javascript and the p5 library. If you wish, you may play it <a href="http://legharir.github.io/test">here.</a>
					</li>
